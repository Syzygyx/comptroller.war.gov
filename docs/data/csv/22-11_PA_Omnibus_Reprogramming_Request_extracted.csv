Refurbishment, repair, and replacement activities continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which created a backlog of customers in need of card processing. As of late September 2021, there was a backlog of more than a half-million people who had expired ID cards and this estimate does not include issuance of new cards. Broken equipment is not returned from field offices in a timely manner consistent with normal operations and this has resulted in a depleted stock of refurbished equipment to supply for operational needs. Replacement cost is further impacted by the Windows systems update and migration, mandated by the DOD Chief Information Officer in FY 2022. While funding for this zero-trust requirement is in the FY 2023 President's Budget request, it is not in the FY 2022 budget. Without additional funding, the DHRA will continue its inability to keep pace with ID card issuance and renewal as RAPIDS workstations fail and are open to cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
