S. Pacific Command (PACOM) to deal with the Anti-Access/Anti-Denial (A2/AD) environment. Talon Hate provides enhanced targeting, situational awareness, multi-domain fused information to tactical users, and an enhanced decisionmaker Common Operational Picture. The Talon Hate effort also increases the military utility by providing counter jamming capability for the Hate pod on the F-15C aircraft, specifically in a contested environment. The Common Operational Picture formed by Talon Hate will increase joint Air Force/Navy interoperability, provide warfighters with a capability to more efficiently engage and defend against next-generation threats in contested environments and reduce kill chain timelines. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) has requested that Talon Hate field in FY 2015 to address the requirement. Without these funds, a stop work will occur in January 2015. This is a MIP project.

These aircraft are Contractor Owned/Contractor Operated and currently supporting operations in Afghanistan. Procurement of these assets will change the ownership of these four existing aircraft from contractor to government. This preserves the Army's ability to use these systems in post-OEF operations. The OCO investment will be leveraged, as the Airborne Reconnaissance Low-Enhanced (ARL-E) program will incorporate the sensors and platforms. This is supported by the March 2014 Saturn Arch/Desert Owl Directed Requirement and the ARL-E Capability Production Document (CPD). This is a congressional special interest item.
