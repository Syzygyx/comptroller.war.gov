","90","00","20","21","Funds will be used to continue development of three different M-Code receivers to be integrated into five Global Positioning System (GPS) -guided munitions (Massive Ordnance Penetrator, Joint Direct Attack Munition, Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) I, SDB IJ, and Joint Air-to-Surface standoff Missile). M-Code receiver development is a strategic military imperative required to enable Positioning Navigation and Timing (PNT) in contested, degraded, and denied environments. The absence of this critical capability will result in additional sorties/target revisits, failure to meet operational goals/objectives, and potential loss of aircraft/life. The shortage of solutions to emerging PNT threats drives less effective changes to our force structure, e.g. requires more weapons (non-precision) and more aircraft to deliver them. Continued delays in delivering M-Code receivers drives significant obsolescence issues for legacy receivers. This is a base budget requirement.","21-01_PA_November_2020_Request-Implemented.pdf"

","90,000","20","22","90,000","Funding is available due to restructure of Form, Fit, Function Refresh (F3R) causing significant delays. F3R is a Diminishing Manufacturer Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) effort to systematically mitigate obsolescence in the missile guidance section and enable missile production. Raytheon Missiles and Defense (RMD) and the program office completed a joint schedule risk assessment moving the F3R Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) from December 2021 to January 2023. This schedule change will cause RMD to delay a portion of Lot 33 production deliveries and delay the previously planned production ramp to build inventory. Funds are available for higher Air Force priorities. There is no impact to the program. This is base budget funding.","21-01_PA_November_2020_Request-Implemented.pdf"
