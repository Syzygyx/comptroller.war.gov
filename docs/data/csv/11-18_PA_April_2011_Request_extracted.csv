Funds are required at laboratories and warfare centers to continue design and prototype efforts necessary to demonstrate the required capability. The systems are required to be accelerated due to the lack of torpedo defense on HVUs, which has been exacerbated by recent real-world events and evolving threats. The systems provide a hard-kill torpedo defense capability in advance of the initial operational capability as part of the program of record.","11-18_PA_April_2011_Request.pdf"
