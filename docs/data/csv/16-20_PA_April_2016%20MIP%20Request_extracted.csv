The current sensors have obsolescence issues that are projected to degrade the WAAS capability in the FY 2019 timeframe due to obsolete components. This effort will result in an ability to continue to execute deployed missions without readiness degradation and will extend the usable life of the current sensor system for approximately 10 additional years. This is a MIP project. This is a base budget requirement.","16-20_PA_April_2016%20MIP%20Request.pdf"
