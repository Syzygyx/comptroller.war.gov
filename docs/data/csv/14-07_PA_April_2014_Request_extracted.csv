The current capability, which was to have been replaced by this capability last year, is operating with multiple critical vulnerabilities. Significant hardware and software obsolescence issues require replacement and re-architecture. Unacceptable information assurance levels and cessation of software vendor support has increased mission performance failure rates beyond acceptable risk. Funds will support test planning and execution, contracted system engineering/inte- gration and information assurance support to achieve upgrade deployment in first quarter FY 2015. This warfighting capability will be DoD’s only database system for worldwide operations in support of identity superiority and positive identification of known or suspected terrorists and third country nationals. This requirement was originally included the November 2013 Prior Approval (FY 14-01 PA) reprogramming action. While all four committees approved the full $13.7 million requirement, they only approved enough funding sources to fund $7.3 million. This request funds the remaining requirement.
