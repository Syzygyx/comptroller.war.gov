Funds are available based on reduced projected costs in FY 2019 (to include additional destruction technologies at Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant (BCAPP) and at the Pueblo Chemical Agent-Destruction Pilot Plant (PCAPP). Due to cost avoidance that will be gained by shortening schedules at both sites, the ACWA program has an asset. This does not inhibit the ability to pursue efforts/technologies to accelerate the destruction of the remaining U.S. chemical weapons stockpile.","19-02_RA_Support_for_DHS_Counter_Drug_Activity.pdf"
