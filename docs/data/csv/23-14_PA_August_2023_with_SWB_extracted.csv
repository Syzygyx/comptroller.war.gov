These Soldier incentives were contracted to counteract a projected fall in Army Guard End-Strength due to COVID-related recruiting restrictions. A portion of these obligations were not recognized during FY 2021 due to a failure of the Guard Incentive Management System (GIMS) to provide correct information for the recording of obligations in the Army accounting system (GFEBS). These increased bonuses were expected to be funded from training events cancelled due to health restrictions. However, the unrecorded obligations from the GIMS interface issues did not give the ARNG a full picture of actual obligations during year end close in FY 2021 and funds were not reserved for all of the SRIP obligations. Once the obligations were correctly reported, overall obligations in the FY 2021 NGPA account exceeded authorized levels, requiring additional funding. The payments that need to be made are not annual installment payments. This is a base budget requirement.","23-14_PA_August_2023_with_SWB.pdf"
