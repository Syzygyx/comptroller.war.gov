Section 1098 required the Department of Defense to modify seven HC-130H aircraft, which were transferred from the Department of Homeland Security (U.S. Coast Guard), for fire suppression purposes and subsequent transfer to the Department of Agriculture for use by the U.S. Forest Service. In FY 2014, the Department reprogrammed $130.0 million via reprogramming actions (FY 14-04 PA (HC-130H Aircraft Request, dated April 8, 2014) and FY 14-06 PA (HC-130H Aircraft Request, dated April 30, 2014)) to support the RDS requirement. However, subsequent to those actions, the program experienced a 1-year delay due to a protest of the Request for Proposal. As a result, the FY 2014 funds will expire prior to contract obligation; therefore, FY 2016 funding is now required to complete the C-130 RDS program by 2018.

The current funding levels and mix of appropriations is based on a representative solution that could fulfill DHMSM requirements. In performing a rigorous acquisition process, the DHMSM program conducted a source selection among competitive bids, which resulted in the award of a contract at a reduced cost. To support development of its Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), the FY 2016 cost estimate for the DHMSM was updated to reflect the actual awarded solution, resulting in the identification of excess FY 2016 funds available in the program.

The entire fleet of B-1 engines has degraded hardware resulting from operation in hot/harsh desert environments. The F101 SLEP ensures engine sustainability through the B-1 service life by improving hot section durability (reduced engine operating temperature). To date, 208 engines have been funded. This funding addresses 21 of the remaining engines in the fleet (289 plus 10 spare engines for a total of 299 engines). Part I of this reprogramming addresses four (4) of these remaining engines.

The current legacy Standard Definition (SD) Cameras were initially deployed in 2003 and contain aging technology that requires frequent repair. Many of these sensors are rapidly nearing their economic useful life due to the operating tempo (OPTEMPO) and environmental conditions. Newer sensors are required to support forward deployed forces assigned to forward operating bases for which BETSS-C is used to enhance the combatant commander’s ability to counter threats by detecting and assessing them at greater range, reduce risk to personnel, reduce intensive manpower requirements of current security protocols and improve chances for mission success. Current areas and operations supported include the U.S. Central Command’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) and U.S. Army Africa AOR - (Horn of Africa). The BETSS-C equipment supports Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) 0296, Operational Needs Statement (ONS) ONS 15-20445, and ONS 15-20713. If unfunded, operational readiness rate for the BETSS-C systems will decline to critical levels and the number of cameras beyond economical repair thresholds will continue to increase. The combatant commander will operate with less capable sensors. Funding will support a one-time buy. This is a new start. The total cost of this new start is estimated at the $11.922 million requested. This is an OCO budget requirement.","16-14_PA_March_2016_Request.pdf"
