The DAWDF allows USAR Troop Program Unit (TPU) Soldiers to receive valuable on-the-job training experience and gain proficiency in contracting and program management to meet the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DA WIA) certification standards. The TPU Soldier's Battle Training Assembly does not provide sufficient time to gain experience or become proficient in contracting processes and procedures. This action does not change the purpose for which the funds were originally appropriated. This is a base budget requirement.","15-32_IR_July_2015_Request.pdf"
