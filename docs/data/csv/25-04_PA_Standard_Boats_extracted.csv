Low Rate Initial Procurement (LRIP) 3 (FY 2023) procurement contract award was delayed until November 2023, and this delayed the LRIP 4 (originally planned FY 2024) production contract award into FY 2025. The FY 2023 and FY 2024 contract awards with the establishment of Advanced Procurement, supporting FY 2025 contract award, would result in three procurement lots delivering at the same time. To smooth out the production line, FY 2024 production was cancelled, and LRIP 4 will be funded with FY 2025 funding. The remaining $58.658 million is required by the program for engineering change orders, production engineering support, and production facilitization to respond to technical issues, production challenges, and address obsolescence issues inherited from AARGM, to maintain sufficient hardware quantities to support procurement through FY 2026. This is a congressional special interest item.","25-04_PA_Standard_Boats.pdf"
