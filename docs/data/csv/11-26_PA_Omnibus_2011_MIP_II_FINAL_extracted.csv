The full FY 2011 Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON) requirement was split into manageable pieces based on production and delivery schedules, funding availability, and to provide time to analyze what items could be harvested from materiel retrograding from Iraq. This request includes three parts: (1) 24 Persistent Threat Detection System (PTDS) contract crews, sustainment costs, and Full Motion Video (FMV) Dissemination for PTDS. There is a critical need for contract crews for systems procured in FY 2011. (2) Persistent Ground Surveillance Systems (PGSS) components, end-items and integrated support costs. Funding also provides for Dual and Wide-Area sensors, FMV dissemination, improved radar systems, support towers, improved sparing, and training systems. This effort is critical to maintain operational availability rates of 95% as requested by theater. (3) Signal Intelligence (SIGNIT) on PGSS aerostats. Funding provides Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) full Persistent Surveillance Surge (PSS) proof-of-concept equipment for 12 PGSS. Funding will support enhanced ISR and force protection to Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) and Combat Outposts (COPs) in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). This funding will support JUON CC-0306-M5. This is an acceleration of an unfunded FY 2012 requirement. This is an Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) requirement. This is a MIP project.","11-26_PA_Omnibus_2011_MIP_II_FINAL.pdf"
