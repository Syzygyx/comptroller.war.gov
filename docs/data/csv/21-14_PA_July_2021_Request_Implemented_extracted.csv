Congress appropriated an additional $2.5 million for Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide appropriation for US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for a demonstration project for contractors employing persons with disabilities to manufacture mechanical tourniquets, but DoD determined such tourniquets must first undergo testing and evaluation of product effectiveness prior to acquisition.
