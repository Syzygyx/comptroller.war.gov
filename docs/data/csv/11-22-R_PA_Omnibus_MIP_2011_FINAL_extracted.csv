This capability will enable the Marine Corps to conduct automated analysis of large volumes of WAS imagery. This effort supports a multi-service effort to deploy a Wide Area Motion Imagery sensor on a Marine Corps-operated RQ-7 UAS in response to CENTCOM JUONS CC-0424 “Wide Area Surveillance.” This was previously approved on FY 11-10 PA (SUONS and ISR TF), but could not be implemented because of the lack of approved funding sources.
