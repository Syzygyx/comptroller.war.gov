","23","23","01","3,568,387","Funds are transferred from the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Air Force 23/24, appropriation for proper execution of an FY 2023 congressional add for atmospheric rivers research that directly supports the Air Force Reserve's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron's operation and research with the purchase and release of dropsondes. Funds are transferred because unit costs will not exceed the $350,000 investment threshold and are more appropriately executed in the Operation and Maintenance, Air Force Reserve, 23/23, appropriation. This does not change the purpose for which the funds were appropriated. This is a congressional special interest item.","23-60_IR_July_2023_signed_20230816.pdf"
