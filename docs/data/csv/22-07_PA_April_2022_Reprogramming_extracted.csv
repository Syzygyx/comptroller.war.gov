This is required for the USCENTCOM Unified Command Plan because Israel is transitioning to the USCENTCOM area of responsibility from U.S. European Command. USCENTCOM must build the bilateral network point of presence at USCENTCOM and transition control of the instantiation of the bilateral network from USEUCOM. Failure to procure the components of the bilateral network for which the times to design and fabricate are extremely long creates unacceptable risk in USCENTCOMâ€™s ability to command and control to implement Operation Plans, Concept of Operations Plans, and exercises. This is a base budget requirement.","22-07_PA_April_2022_Reprogramming.pdf"
