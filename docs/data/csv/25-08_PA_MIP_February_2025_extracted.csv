","24","25","063","060","Funds are required to identify, develop, and enhance biometric technologies in support of credibility assessments (CA); design tradecraft for the effective and objective use of these technologies; and provide a viable path forward to integrate and deploy these technologies in support of Department of Defense (DoD) mission. The ongoing “Polygraph+ initiative” is an effort to modernize DoD credibility assessment approaches and techniques by building upon and field testing two commercial systems. The requested funds will include 1) scientific evaluation and comparison of non-contact sensors of autonomic nervous system activity, 2) integration of biosignals from best-in-class sensors identified during the evaluation/comparison phase into a cost-effective next-generation credibility assessment system, and 3) field’ testing activities with live examiners across polygraph programs to refine instrument validity and usability. This is a congressional special interest item. This is a MIP project.","25-08_PA_MIP_February_2025.pdf"
