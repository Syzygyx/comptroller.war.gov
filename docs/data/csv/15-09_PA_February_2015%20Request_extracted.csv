Execution of these DMIX activities requires Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding for proper execution vice the currently budgeted and available Defense Health Program (DHP), Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, 15/16, appropriation. The funding enacted for the DMIX initiative was based on an original strategy for the integrated Electronic Heath Record (EHR). This strategy included developing substantial new IT capabilities for the exchange of health care data between DoD, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and private sector care providers, as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2014. Over the past year, the Department performed a technical review of existing DoD data exchange systems and has determined that improving and enhancing these systems would increase data exchange capacity and be a more economical option to meet these requirements.

Over the past year, the Department performed a technical review of existing DoD data exchange systems and has determined that improving and enhancing these systems would increase data exchange capacity and be a more economical option to meet these requirements. The current funding levels and mix of appropriations is based on the original strategy for the Integrated Electronic Heath Record ((EHR), which included substantial new development of capabilities. The original strategy included developing a new Clinical Terminology Service, using the Open Health Data Dictionary (HDD) product, developing a Data Management Service to replace the existing data exchange services such as Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE), and a DoD Adaptor and Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Adaptor. The technical review determined that the current systems were robust enough and stable enough to handle the anticipated workload (i.e., number of transactions per hour) needed to securely and reliably exchange the required health data. Due to some minor configuration changes and cleanup of unused code with the existing BHIE DoD Adaptor, it was proven to support a","15-09_PA_February_2015%20Request.pdf"

Funds will be used to connect Patriot sites to the fixed commercial power grid, and includes 36 backup generators (250kW) if the commercial prime power fails. Currently, the organic Patriot system tactical prime power generators are being used continuously and experiencing reduced readiness rates. Establishing connections to the commercial power grid for prime power generation will reduce the strain on Patriot system equipment and increase readiness rates. If not funded, the heavy organic generator use will continue to degrade equipment and reduce Patriot readiness rates, increasing operational risk.
