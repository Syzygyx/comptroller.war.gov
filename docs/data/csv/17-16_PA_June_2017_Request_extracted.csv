The additional funds will achieve the Navyâ€™s goal of 6-months lead time for PCS notification, will minimize the short-notice impact on Fleet readiness, allow for career milestone management, reduce family turbulence, support global assignment rotations and critical readiness fills, minimize gaps at sea for deploying units and those units preparing to deploy, and keep the training pipelines flowing. Current funding levels have resulted in Sailors' receipt of orders, on average, of one month prior to actual move for shore duty. In many cases, Sailors have been required to remain on station longer until funds were available. The additional funding will resource additional moves to achieve the optimal PCS notification lead time, including 5,841 Training Travel moves, 11,234 Operation Travel moves between duty stations, and 9,761 Rotational Travel moves to and from overseas locations.
