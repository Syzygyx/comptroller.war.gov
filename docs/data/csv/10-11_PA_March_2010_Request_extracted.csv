In August 2007, Blanek, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), recommended that the Air Force reduce the safe service life of the TG-10C from 2,000 hours to 1,000 hours based on the demanding curriculum and high usage rate. The Air Force obtained OEM support in August 2009 to begin data collection and analysis to determine possible life extensions. Preliminary results indicate a maximum service life extension possibility of 100 additional flight hours. With that extension, the current glider aircraft will begin reaching the end of their service life in early 2011, necessitating an out-of-cycle request to avoid a loss of training and to protect the safety of Air Force Academy cadets. This is a new start.","10-11_PA_March_2010_Request.pdf"
