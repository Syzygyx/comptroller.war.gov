The SSI Increment 8 Navigator / ESGN-R will be installed on the current OHIO Class and is also on the critical path for the OHIO Replacement Program (ORP), as the baseline Shipboard Strategic Weapons System that will be ported over to the ORP. Without this funding, along with $6.675 million requested in Part III, the Initial Operational Capability for the SSI Increment 8 Navigator / ESGN-R will be delayed by up to two years, significantly increasing the risk to the ability of the current OHIO Class to meet strategic deterrence mission requirements, and hinder the design of the OHIO Replacement Program.
