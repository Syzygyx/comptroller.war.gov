Since the FY 2024 President’s Budget submission, the Army enlisted average strength has increased by approximately 700 average strength and the population is at a higher average grade than projected. This grade mix has increased the average cost per enlisted Soldier by $20K. In addition, the actual basic allowance for housing (BAH); rates are slightly higher than projected, (budgeted at 3.9% versus the actual January 1, 2024, inflation increase of 4.5%). The total shortfall from the changes to the enlisted grade structure and the BAH inflation is $164.907 million. The Army also has an increased requirement of approximately $30 million for recruiting incentives to achieve the projected FY 2024 end strength of 445,000. The Army is prioritizing recruiting critical skill MOSs with targeted bonuses and incentives, to achieve an overall accession objective of 55,000.
