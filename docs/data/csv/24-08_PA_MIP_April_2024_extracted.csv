","23","24","07","030","Funds are required to add the Project Critical Intelligence of Unique Signals (CRIUS) capability to RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT aircraft. Project CRIUS originally addressed a unique signal set for RC-135U COMBAT SENT aircraft and has been added to the COMBAT SENT baseline six upgrades. The Combatant Commands now require greater exposure and persistence in the battlespace by fielding CRIUS on the more extensive RC-135V/W RIVET JOINT fleet and expanding worldwide collection â€” capabilities. However, equipment space is more limited on the RIVET JOINT. Adaptations to the CRIUS system are required to reduce size, weight, and power to field the capability on the RIVET JOINT aircraft. This request funds the non-reoccurring engineering (NRE)/integration associated with the effort. Additional classified details can be provided under separate cover. This is a MIP PROJECT.","24-08_PA_MIP_April_2024.pdf"
