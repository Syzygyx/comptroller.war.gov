This funding will fulfill a critical tactical capability gap highlighted during ongoing forward deployed operations associated with Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Forces and Marine Expeditionary Units. The gap is related to logistics activities in support of dispersed and disaggregated company level operations. The UTV will provide a proven solution that is cost-effective, reliable, easily maintained , and certified for internal transportation in the Osprey Multi- mission Variant (MV 22) aircraft and in the Super Stallion Cargo Helicopter (CH 53E). The UTV funding includes procurement, operator and maintainer training, and parts blocks for forward deployed units. This is a new start.

The Air Force currently projects execution of 6,476 enlisted workyears compared to the budgeted request of 4,910 workyears. This revision of enlisted workyears is due in large part to (1) a concerted effort by the Air Force to increase RC utilization which improves Active Component deployment-to-dwell ratios, (2) a deliberate decision (at the request of the Joint Staff) to expand the Remotely Piloted Aircraft and Distributed Common Ground/Surface System capacity that the Air Force provides to the Combatant Command, and (3) an increase in unexpected emergent requirements (such as counter-ISIL and counter-terrorism support).
